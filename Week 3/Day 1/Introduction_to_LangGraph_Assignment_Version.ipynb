    "## Part 1: LangGraph - Building Cyclic Applications with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

    "Earlier we used this phrasing:\n",
    "\n",
    "`coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications`\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We initialize our state object:\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : []}`\n",
    "2. Our user submits a query to our application.\n",
    "  - New State: `HumanMessage(#1)`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1)}`\n",
    "3. We pass our state object to an Agent node which is able to read the current state. It will use the last `HumanMessage` as input. It gets some kind of output which it will add to the state.\n",
    "  - New State: `AgentMessage(#1, additional_kwargs {\"function_call\" : \"WebSearchTool\"})`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1), AgentMessage(#1, ...)]}`\n",
    "4. We pass our state object to a \"conditional node\" (more on this later) which reads the last state to determine if we need to use a tool - which it can determine properly because of our provided object!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

       "'RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as a transformer-based model like GPT-3, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model might not have enough information to produce a high-quality response on its own. By leveraging external knowledge through retrieval, RAG can significantly enhance the performance of language models in tasks such as question answering, dialogue systems, and more.'"

       "   'output': \"A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a type of artificial intelligence model that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve the quality and relevance of generated responses. Here's a breakdown of the components and how they work together:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval Component**: This part of the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. It uses techniques from information retrieval, such as keyword matching, semantic search, or more advanced methods like dense retrieval using neural networks.\\n\\n2. **Generation Component**: This part of the system generates a response based on the retrieved information and the input query. It typically uses a language model, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), to produce coherent and contextually appropriate text.\\n\\n### How RAG Works:\\n1. **Input Query**: The system receives an input query from the user.\\n2. **Retrieval Phase**: The retrieval component searches a large database or corpus to find the most relevant documents or passages related to the query.\\n3. **Augmentation Phase**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query, providing additional context and information.\\n4. **Generation Phase**: The generation component uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context from the retrieved documents helps the language model produce more accurate and relevant answers.\\n\\n### Benefits of RAG:\\n- **Improved Relevance**: By incorporating relevant information from a large corpus, the system can generate responses that are more accurate and contextually appropriate.\\n- **Knowledge Integration**: The system can leverage external knowledge sources, making it more knowledgeable and capable of answering a wider range of questions.\\n- **Flexibility**: RAG systems can be applied to various tasks, including question answering, summarization, and conversational agents.\\n\\n### Applications:\\n- **Customer Support**: Providing accurate and contextually relevant answers to customer queries.\\n- **Educational Tools**: Assisting students with detailed and well-informed responses to their questions.\\n- **Research Assistance**: Helping researchers find and synthesize information from large datasets.\\n\\nOverall, RAG systems represent a powerful approach to combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods, leading to more effective and intelligent AI systems.\",\n",

       "   'output': 'LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique used primarily in the context of fine-tuning large language models. It introduces several significant improvements over traditional fine-tuning methods:\\n\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by decomposing the weight updates into low-rank matrices. This makes the fine-tuning process more efficient and less resource-intensive.\\n\\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: By reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated, LoRA also reduces the memory footprint during training. This is particularly beneficial when working with very large models.\\n\\n3. **Faster Training**: With fewer parameters to update, the training process can be faster. This allows for quicker iterations and experimentation.\\n\\n4. **Better Generalization**: LoRA can help in achieving better generalization by preventing overfitting. The low-rank constraint acts as a form of regularization, which can lead to improved performance on unseen data.\\n\\n5. **Scalability**: LoRA is scalable to very large models, making it suitable for fine-tuning state-of-the-art language models without the need for extensive computational resources.\\n\\n6. **Flexibility**: LoRA can be applied to various parts of the model, such as attention layers or feed-forward layers, providing flexibility in how the fine-tuning is performed.\\n\\n7. **Compatibility**: LoRA is compatible with existing training pipelines and can be easily integrated into current workflows without significant changes.\\n\\nThese improvements make LoRA a powerful technique for fine-tuning large language models, offering a balance between efficiency and performance.',\n",
